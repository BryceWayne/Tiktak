### Services Layer
- **Purpose**: The services layer contains the business logic of the application. It's where you define the rules and operations that your application needs to perform.
- **Functions**: After data is fetched or before it's saved to the database, the services layer processes it, applies business rules, makes decisions, orchestrates transactions, etc.
- **Interaction with Data**: While it uses data accessed through the repository layer, it's more concerned with what to do with this data - validating it, transforming it, applying business rules, etc.
- **Benefits**: Separating business logic into a dedicated layer makes the code easier to test, maintain, and extend. It also means that changes in business requirements are less likely to require changes in the data access layer.
