### Repository Layer
- **Purpose**: The repository layer is primarily concerned with data access. Its main responsibility is to interact with the database or any data source.
- **Functions**: It handles CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations and essentially acts as a bridge between the business logic and the database.
- **Abstraction**: By abstracting database access, it allows the rest of the application to interact with the database without needing to know the details of the underlying data source.
- **Benefits**: This layer makes it easier to manage changes to the database schema, switch databases, or change data access technologies without affecting the business logic.
