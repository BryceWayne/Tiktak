## DEMO for gRPC Implementation

### Integrating Protobufs into Your Go Project

1. **Create .proto Files**: Place the above definitions in `.proto` files within your project. For instance, `user.proto` and `video.proto` inside a `proto` directory.

2. **Generate Go Code**: Use the `protoc` compiler with the Go plugin to generate Go code from your protobuf definitions. For example:

   ```bash
   protoc --go_out=. --go_opt=paths=source_relative --go-grpc_out=. --go-grpc_opt=paths=source_relative proto/*.proto
   ```

   This command generates Go files with the necessary structs and gRPC service interfaces based on your protobuf definitions.

3. **Implement gRPC Services**: Use the generated Go code to implement your gRPC services. This involves writing the server-side logic for handling gRPC calls.

4. **Client-Server Communication**: You can then use the generated client code to make gRPC calls from other services or applications.

5. **Handling Timestamps**: Since protobuf's `Timestamp` type is used in the `Video` message, you'll need to handle the conversion between Go's `time.Time` and protobuf's `Timestamp`.

6. **Dependency Management**: Ensure you have the necessary gRPC and Protobuf libraries in your `go.mod` file. For example, `google.golang.org/grpc` and `google.golang.org/protobuf`.

By following these steps, you'll integrate protobufs into your Go project, setting the stage for implementing gRPC-based communication. This approach leverages the efficiency and strong typing of gRPC/protobufs, which can be particularly beneficial for server-to-server interactions in your application.
